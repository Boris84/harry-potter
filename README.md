Harry Potter Characters

Learning how to make request and handle responses.

I used a 'plain javascript' AJAX request to GET the Harry Potter API and rendered it in the browser using vanilla js and CSS Grid. I also filtered the users search results so that the characters that a user types in will be checked against the characters in the character names and will show or hide the images based on that result, which will eventually narrow down the search to just one image/character.
