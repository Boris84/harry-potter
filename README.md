Harry Potter Characters

Learning how to make request and handle responses.

I used an AJAX XHR request to GET the harry potter API and rendered it in the browser using vanilla js and CSS Grid. I also filtered the users search results so that the characters that a user types in corresponds with the characters in the character names and will display images based on that.
